Thanks for the assesment it was fun building this website. Much Thanks!

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and bring my expertise
in web development to your organization.

## To increase the optimization:

If I ahd been using an api I would incorporate Redux to reduce the number of api hits to make it more optimized.

## Tech Stack Used:

React + Typescript + Tailwind

Node Version : v22.12.0(LTS)

-> The website utilizes images that are stored in the assets directory located within the src folder.
These images are essential for the visual presentation of the application.

->The JSON data required by the application is stored in a file named detail.json, which is located in the data directory under the public folder.
This file contains the necessary hotel information that the application uses to render hotel details and listings.

-->his requires you to install react alone with typescript and tailwind css framework.

(CHECK THE NODE VERSION IF IT IS LTS)
